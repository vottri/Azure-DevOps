Check for working Internet connection.

Update your system

```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

Install some required packages:

```sh
sudo apt-get -y install wget apt-transport-https
```

### Install ASP.NET Core Runtime 3.1 

**Register the Microsoft Product key as trusted**

```sh
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
```

**Install .NET Core Runtime (allows you to run apps that were made with .NET Core)**

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y aspnetcore-runtime-3.1 
```
![dotnet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vottri/Azure-DevOps/main/images2/dotnet.png)

### Create a systemd file for your web application (run your webapp as a service).

Create your web app service file.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/devopsweb.service
```

```sh
[Unit]
Description=Example .NET Web App running on Ubuntu

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/cloud_user/devopsweb/
ExecStart=/home/cloud_user/devopsweb/DevOpsWeb
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
KillSignal=SIGINT
User=cloud_user
Environment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
Environment=ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://*:5000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable your web app service.

```sh
sudo systemctl enable devopsweb.service
```

### Installing Nginx webserver

Install Nginx.

```sh
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```

Start Nginx Server.

```sh
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to ASP.NET Core app:

Create a new file /etc/nginx/sites-available/devopsweb for your webapp.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/devopsweb
```

```sh
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 127.0.0.1;
    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Create a symlink for your webapp in the sites-enabled directory.

```sh
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/devopsweb /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/devopsweb
```

Remove the default website in the sites-enabled directory.

```sh
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Restart nginx server.

```sh
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
